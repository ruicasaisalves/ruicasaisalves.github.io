subtitle: Data Analyst, Dad, Curious.
---

My name is Rui Alves. I am a dad, a **data analyst** and a curious person.

### My story

My field of studies is **Economics** (BsC), but soon i found out that exploring data would be the best way to answer business questions.

So in the last years, my focus was on mastering SQL, Power BI and of course Excel.
I am a Microsoft Certified **Power BI Data Analyst**.

I like to solve complex problems with (hopefully) simple solutions.
